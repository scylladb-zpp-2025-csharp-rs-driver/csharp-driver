# ScyllaDB C# RS Driver

![CI workflow](https://github.com/scylladb/csharp-rs-driver/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)

This is a client-side driver for [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/) written in C# and Rust.
This driver is an overlay over the [ScyllaDB Rust Driver](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver),
with the interface based on the [ScyllaDB C# Driver](https://github.com/scylladb/csharp-driver) (a fork of the DataStax C# Driver for Apache Cassandra).
Although optimized for ScyllaDB, the driver is also compatible with [Apache Cassandra®](https://cassandra.apache.org/).

The driver targets .NET 8+.

## Getting started

### Installation

The driver is not published to NuGet yet, so it has to be built manually from source. You need:

- the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) 8 or 9,
- a [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) supporting edition 2024 (Rust 1.85 or newer).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scylladb/csharp-rs-driver.git
cd csharp-rs-driver
cp build/scylladb-dev.snk build/scylladb.snk   # development assembly signing key
dotnet build src/Cassandra/Cassandra.csproj
```

### Documentation

The documentation sources live in the [`docs`](docs/source) directory:

- [Getting started](docs/source/topics/getting-started.md)
- [Migration guide](docs/source/migration-guide/index.md) — API differences against the C# Driver
- [Using the driver](docs/source/topics/using) — statements, data types, paging, metadata, routing
- [Observability](docs/source/topics/observability) — logging and tracing

Unimplemented features are tracked in the repository [issues](https://github.com/scylladb/csharp-rs-driver/issues).

### Examples

You can find example usages of the driver in the [examples directory](examples). Each example is a standalone console
application; the [examples README](examples/README.MD) marks the ones that do not work in the current release.

### Basic usage

```csharp
// Configure the builder with your cluster's contact points
var cluster = Cluster.Builder()
                     .AddContactPoints("host1")
                     .Build();

// Connect to the nodes using a keyspace
var session = cluster.Connect("sample_keyspace");

// Execute a query on a connection synchronously
var rs = session.Execute("SELECT * FROM sample_table");

// Iterate through the RowSet
foreach (var row in rs)
{
    var value = row.GetValue<int>("sample_int_column");

    // Do something with the value
}
```

## Features

The driver supports the following:

- Simple and prepared statements, executed synchronously (`Execute`) or asynchronously (`ExecuteAsync`)
- Asynchronous IO, parallel execution, request pipelining
- Automatic paging — configurable page size with transparent multi-page iteration, both sync and async
- Connection pooling, auto node discovery and automatic reconnection
- Configurable load balancing: datacenter preference and datacenter failover
- Full CQL data type coverage: all native types (including `counter`, `decimal`, `varint`, `duration`, `inet`,
  `date`/`time`/`timestamp`, `uuid`/`timeuuid`), collections, tuples, user-defined types and vectors
- Schema metadata: keyspaces with replication strategy, tables, columns, primary keys, UDTs and cluster nodes
- Replica lookup with `GetReplicas`
- Automatic schema agreement checks (`WaitForSchemaAgreement`)
- TCP socket options: `TCP_NODELAY`, keepalive and its interval, send/receive buffer sizes, `SO_REUSEADDR`, zero linger
- Error handling based on the Rust driver, mapped onto the existing C# exception hierarchy
- Driver logging: Rust `tracing` events forwarded to `System.Diagnostics.Trace` and to an `ILoggerFactory`
- CQL binary protocol version 4

## Not yet supported

These parts of the C# Driver API are present but not yet wired to the Rust driver:

- Batch statements
- Authentication
- SSL/TLS, and SNI / secure connection bundles (ScyllaDB Cloud)
- Retry policies, speculative execution and reconnection policy configuration
- Execution profiles
- Driver metrics (App.Metrics) and OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- Column encryption
- Query tracing, client warnings, custom payloads and client-side timestamps
- Materialized view, secondary index, UDF/UDA and virtual table metadata
- Heartbeat and connection pool tuning options

Some APIs were removed or changed rather than postponed; the [migration guide](docs/source/migration-guide/index.md)
lists them together with the reasoning and the recommended replacements.

## Building and running the tests

```bash
make check                        # formatting, linting and code analysis (C# and Rust)
make test-unit                    # unit tests
make test-integration-simulacron  # integration tests against Simulacron
make test-integration-scylla      # integration tests against a CCM-managed ScyllaDB cluster
make test-logging                 # logging tests (each case runs in a fresh process)
```
